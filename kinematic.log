I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

I'm guessing that you meant to end an alignment here.

I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

! Missing $ inserted.

l.11 
     
Displays can use special alignments (like \eqalignno)
only if nothing but the alignment itself is between $$'s.

! Misplaced alignment tab character &.
\reserved@a ->&
               
l.12 \end{eqnarray*}
                    
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
here. If you just want an ampersand, the remedy is
simple: Just type `I\&' now. But if some right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

! Misplaced \cr.
\@@eqncr ...l \@eqnswtrue \global \@eqcnt \z@ \cr 
                                                  
l.12 \end{eqnarray*}
                    
I can't figure out why you would want to use a tab mark
or \cr or \span just now. If something like a right brace
up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,
you're probably due for more error messages, and you
might try typing `S' now just to see what is salvageable.

l.12 \end{eqnarray*}
                    
I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be
spurious, as in `$x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and
you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

! Missing $ inserted.

l.12 \end{eqnarray*}
                    
The `$' that I just saw supposedly matches a previous `$$'.
So I shall assume that you typed `$$' both times.
